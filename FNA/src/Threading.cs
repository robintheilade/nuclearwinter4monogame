#region THREADED_GL Option
// #define THREADED_GL
/* Ah, so I see you've run into some issues with threaded GL...
 *
 * This class is designed to handle rendering coming from multiple threads, but
 * if you're too wreckless with how many threads are calling the GL, this will
 * hang.
 *
 * With THREADED_GL we instead allow you to run threaded rendering using
 * multiple GL contexts. This is more flexible, but much more dangerous.
 *
 * Also note that this affects SDL2/SDL2_GamePlatform and Graphics/OpenGLDevice.cs!
 * Check THREADED_GL there too.
 *
 * Basically, if you have to enable this, you should feel very bad.
