NuclearWinter
=============

_NuclearWinter_ is a set of libraries to develop games and applications using XNA and [FNA](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/FNA) on Windows, Mac and Linux.

It featuring game state management, an input manager and a fairly versatile user interface library.

NuclearWinter used to contain the VectorLevel library for rendering 2D levels based on SVG files edited with [Inkscape](http://inksape.org/), but it has been removed for now as it is currently unmaintained. You can still find it in older revisions.

NuclearWinter is distributed under the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt). Feel free to use it in your own projects! Contributions are welcome too.
